### Networking

#### List of network requests by screen

   -  Api rules
      - (Access Control) This allows anybody to read and post from the database. No authentications required for now.
      ```json
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
             match /{document=**} {
               allow read, write: if
                  request.time < timestamp.date(2021, 5, 6);
                }
            }
        }
      ```
   -  Instructor Class 
  
      - (Read/GET) This is the call to the api to retrieve data from firebasefirestore real-time database (instructor data only)
         ```java
        public LinkedList<Map<String, Object>> read()
        {
        //This the api call made to the user collection on the cloud real-time database
        db.collection("user").document("WoW4mXdA8bBB0SHAgwdW").collection("instructor")
                .get()
                .addOnCompleteListener(task -> {
                    LinkedList<Map<String,Object> > list = new LinkedList<>();
                    if (task.isSuccessful()) {
                        //This for loop is used to retrieve data. Instead of getting the whole chunk of data
                        //we can get indivual snapshots at a time and manipulate it as we please.
                        for (QueryDocumentSnapshot document : Objects.requireNonNull(task.getResult())) {
                            //This log statement is there to help us debug.
                            //document.getdata() is the key function that returns a map instance of the information stored on the cloud
                            Log.d(TAG, document.getId() + " => " + document.getData().toString());
                            //while the loop is running and retrieving data, we are pushing each instance into a local linked list
                            list.add(document.getData()); } }
                    else {
                        Log.w(TAG, "Error getting documents.", task.getException()); }
                    //This is there for debuggin purposes.
                    //We basically coping the local linked list into a global element.
                    instructors.addAll(list); });
                //The global linkedlist is then returned
         return instructors;

        }
         ```
      - (Create/POST) Create a new instructor
        ```java
            public void write(Instructor inst) {
                // Create a new instructor
                Map<String, String> instructor = new HashMap<>();
                instructor.put("first_name", inst.getFirst_name());
                instructor.put("last_name", inst.getLast_name());
                instructor.put("email", inst.getEmail());
                instructor.put("profile_picture", inst.getProfile_picture());
                // Add a new document with a generated ID
                db.collection("user").document("WoW4mXdA8bBB0SHAgwdW").collection("instructor")
                    .add(instructor) //this is the point where we add the map to the database
                    .addOnSuccessListener(new OnSuccessListener<DocumentReference>() {                    
                        @Override
                        public void onSuccess(DocumentReference documentReference) {
                            Log.d(TAG, "DocumentSnapshot added with ID: " + documentReference.getId()); }
                    })
                    .addOnFailureListener(new OnFailureListener() {
                        @Override
                        public void onFailure(@NonNull Exception e) {
                            Log.w(TAG, "Error adding document", e);
                        }
